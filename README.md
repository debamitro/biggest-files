# biggest-files
An attempt to quickly find the biggest files (or directories) in a directory. Totally work in progress

Update: I am not maintaining this any more, because a [much better version](https://github.com/debamitro/du-gui-rs) has been productized.

## How to run

```bash
biggest-files <directory-name> <minimum-size-in-MB>
```
